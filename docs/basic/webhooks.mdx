# Webhook Integration

Learn how to set up and use PromptPal's webhook system to receive real-time notifications when your prompts are executed.

## What are Webhooks?

Webhooks allow PromptPal to send automatic notifications to your applications when specific events occur. Currently, PromptPal supports the `onPromptFinished` event, which triggers whenever a prompt execution completes (successfully or with errors).

This enables you to:
- Monitor prompt execution in real-time
- Track usage analytics
- Integrate with your existing systems
- Build automated workflows based on prompt results

## Setting Up Webhooks

Webhooks are configured per project in your PromptPal dashboard. Each webhook configuration includes:

- **Target URL**: The endpoint where notifications will be sent
- **Event Type**: Currently `onPromptFinished` for prompt completion events  
- **Status**: Enable/disable the webhook

To configure a webhook:
1. Navigate to your project settings
2. Go to the Webhooks section
3. Add your webhook endpoint URL
4. Enable the webhook

## Understanding Webhook Payloads

When a prompt finishes executing, PromptPal sends a POST request to your webhook URL with detailed information about the execution.

### Request Details

- **Method**: `POST` 
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
- **User-Agent**: `PromptPal@{version}`
- **Timeout**: 10 seconds (your endpoint must respond within this time)

### Payload Structure

```json
{
  "event": "onPromptFinished",
  "projectId": 123,
  "promptId": 456,
  "userId": "user-123",
  "result": 0,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "duration": 1250,
  "tokens": {
    "prompt": 150,
    "completion": 300,
    "total": 450
  },
  "cached": false,
  "ip": "192.168.1.1",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "providerId": 789,
  "providerDefaultModel": "gpt-4"
}
```

### Field Reference

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `event` | string | Always `"onPromptFinished"` |
| `projectId` | number | ID of the project containing the prompt |
| `promptId` | number | ID of the executed prompt |
| `userId` | string | ID of the user who executed the prompt |
| `result` | number | `0` for success, `1` for failure |
| `timestamp` | string | When the prompt finished (ISO 8601 format) |
| `duration` | number | Execution time in milliseconds |
| `tokens.prompt` | number | Tokens in the input prompt |
| `tokens.completion` | number | Tokens in the AI response |
| `tokens.total` | number | Total tokens used |
| `cached` | boolean | Whether response was cached |
| `ip` | string | Client IP address |
| `userAgent` | string | Client user agent |
| `providerId` | number | AI provider ID (optional) |
| `providerDefaultModel` | string | Provider's default model (optional) |

## Implementing Webhook Endpoints

Your webhook endpoint should return a 2xx HTTP status code to indicate successful receipt.

### Basic Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "received"
}
```

### Example Implementations

#### Node.js with Express

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/webhook/promptpal', (req, res) => {
  const payload = req.body;
  
  console.log('Prompt executed:', {
    projectId: payload.projectId,
    promptId: payload.promptId,
    success: payload.result === 0,
    duration: payload.duration + 'ms',
    totalTokens: payload.tokens.total
  });
  
  // Your custom logic here
  processWebhookData(payload);
  
  res.status(200).json({ status: 'received' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Webhook server running on port 3000');
});
```

#### Python with Flask

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook/promptpal', methods=['POST'])
def handle_webhook():
    payload = request.get_json()
    
    print(f"Prompt executed in project {payload['projectId']}")
    print(f"Result: {'success' if payload['result'] == 0 else 'failure'}")
    print(f"Duration: {payload['duration']}ms")
    print(f"Tokens used: {payload['tokens']['total']}")
    
    # Your custom logic here
    process_webhook_data(payload)
    
    return jsonify({"status": "received"}), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=3000)
```

## Best Practices

### Security

- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS endpoints in production
- **Validate payloads**: Check that requests contain expected fields
- **Implement rate limiting**: Protect your endpoint from abuse
- **Log requests**: Keep logs for monitoring and debugging

### Performance  

- **Respond quickly**: Return 200 status immediately, process data asynchronously
- **Handle timeouts**: Ensure your endpoint responds within 10 seconds
- **Scale appropriately**: Design for your expected webhook volume

### Error Handling

PromptPal considers any 2xx status code as successful delivery. For failed deliveries:
- The failure is logged for monitoring
- Webhook call details are recorded
- **No automatic retries** are performed

## Common Use Cases

### Analytics Dashboard
Track prompt usage, success rates, and token consumption across your projects.

### Monitoring & Alerts
Set up notifications when prompts fail or when token usage exceeds thresholds.

### Workflow Automation  
Trigger downstream processes based on prompt completion, such as updating databases or sending notifications.

### Cost Tracking
Monitor token usage for billing and budget management.

## Testing Your Webhook

1. **Set up a test endpoint** that logs all incoming requests
2. **Configure the webhook URL** in your PromptPal project settings  
3. **Execute a test prompt** in your project
4. **Verify the webhook** is received at your endpoint

You can use tools like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a public tunnel to your local development server for testing.

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Received

- Verify the webhook is enabled in project settings
- Check that your endpoint URL is publicly accessible
- Ensure your endpoint responds within 10 seconds
- Test your endpoint URL directly

### Timeout Issues

- Process webhook data asynchronously  
- Return a 200 response immediately
- Optimize your webhook processing code
- Consider queuing heavy processing tasks

### SSL/HTTPS Errors

- Verify your SSL certificate is valid
- Use a trusted certificate authority
- Test your endpoint with SSL verification tools

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues with webhook integration:

1. Check your endpoint logs for incoming requests
2. Review PromptPal's webhook delivery logs  
3. Verify network connectivity and SSL certificates
4. Contact PromptPal support with specific error details

Webhook logs in PromptPal include request/response details, timing information, and error messages to help diagnose delivery issues.
