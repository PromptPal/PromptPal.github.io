# Introducing PromptPal 1.12 - Advanced API Security

If you've used any LLM API, you've probably noticed that they typically provide a static secret token for backend use. But what about the client side?

PromptPal has addressed this issue by designing a workflow that allows secure client-side prompt execution.

For more information, please read our [Advanced API Security](https://promptpal.github.io/docs/developer-tools/Advanced%20API%20Security) documentation.

# Introducing PromptPal 1.13 - IP Tracking

We have enhanced our prompt tracking feature by adding an IP field, making it easier for users to identify traffic sources.

The page has become more complex than before, so we are working on designing a more powerful and user-friendly interface to display this data. Please stay tuned!

**PS:** The maintainer will be on a long vacation and may not be able to code for a month. If you have any good ideas, please email me at annatar.he+pp@gmail.com. I'll consider adding more features after my vacation!
