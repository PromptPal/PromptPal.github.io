<ReleaseHero version="1.16.3" features={["Webhooks", "RBAC", "AI Providers", "Enhanced Security"]} />

We're excited to announce PromptPal 1.16.3, our most feature-rich release yet! This update brings powerful new capabilities that enhance integration, security, and flexibility for your AI prompt management workflows.

# üîó Webhook Support

PromptPal now supports webhooks, enabling real-time notifications and seamless integration with your existing systems. Whether you need to trigger external processes when prompts are executed, monitor usage patterns, or integrate with CI/CD pipelines, webhooks provide the flexibility you need.

Key webhook features:
- **Real-time notifications** for prompt execution events
- **Configurable endpoints** for different event types
- **Secure delivery** with signature verification
- **Retry mechanisms** for reliable event delivery

This opens up countless integration possibilities, from updating external dashboards to triggering automated workflows based on prompt activity.

# üîê Enhanced API Security

Building on our previous API security improvements, version 1.16.3 introduces additional security enhancements that make your prompt infrastructure even more secure:

- **Enhanced token management** with improved lifecycle controls
- **Request validation** with comprehensive input sanitization
- **Audit logging** for security monitoring and compliance
- **Rate limiting improvements** for better protection against abuse

These improvements ensure your prompts remain secure while maintaining the performance and flexibility you expect from PromptPal.

# üë• RBAC Support (Experimental)

We're introducing experimental Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to help teams manage permissions and access to prompts more effectively. This feature allows organizations to:

- **Define custom roles** with specific permissions
- **Assign users to roles** based on their responsibilities  
- **Control access** to different prompts and environments
- **Manage team collaboration** with fine-grained permissions

*Note: RBAC is currently in experimental status. We're actively collecting feedback to refine this feature before the stable release.*

# ü§ñ AI Provider Support

PromptPal 1.16.3 expands AI provider support beyond our existing integrations, making it easier to work with different AI models and services:

- **Enhanced provider abstraction** for seamless switching between AI services
- **Improved configuration management** for multiple providers
- **Better error handling** across different provider APIs
- **Performance optimizations** for provider-specific features

This enhancement ensures PromptPal remains provider-agnostic while leveraging the unique capabilities of each AI service.

# üöÄ Additional Improvements

This release also includes numerous quality-of-life improvements:

- **Performance optimizations** for faster prompt execution
- **UI/UX enhancements** for better user experience
- **Bug fixes** and stability improvements
- **Documentation updates** to reflect new features
