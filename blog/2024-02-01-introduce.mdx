## Introducing PromptPal

**PromptPal is a prompt manager designed for on-premise environments, focusing on improving the developer experience when working with Large Language Models (LLMs).**

## Why You Need a Prompt Manager

We know you're **eager to build** with AI, but as you start developing new features, managing your prompts can become **challenging**. Having them scattered throughout your codebase makes them difficult to **reuse, maintain, and share** with colleagues.

Implementing a simple `PromptService` might seem inadequate, lacking proper organization for **efficient management**. Additionally, deploying, debugging, A/B testing, and monitoring prompt performance can be **time-consuming and tedious**.

These challenges can lead to wasted time and decreased productivity. PromptPal aims to solve these issues and **streamline your LLM development workflow**.

## PromptPal Features

PromptPal is a web service with **rich tools** to help developers work with LLMs.

Of course, it can manage prompts, with tracing and debugging capabilities. But PromptPal offers more at a **low cost**:

### On-Premise Deployment

It works perfectly in an on-premise environment and is **easy to set up**.

The only thing you need to set up PromptPal is a single `.env` configuration file and a one-line command:

```bash
podman run -d --rm --network host -v '/promptpal/.env:/usr/app/.env:ro' annatarhe/prompt-pal:v1.6.0
```

### Low Costs

Its lightweight architecture guarantees efficient resource utilization, ensuring **optimal performance**. And all this functionality requires only **12.3MB of memory**[^1]!

### Developer Experience

We are developers too, so **developer experience matters**.

We provide a CLI: [https://github.com/PromptPal/cli](https://github.com/PromptPal/cli) to help developers set up integration with PromptPal. With this CLI, you can set up a configuration file in your project and generate type declarations in **just one line of code**:

```bash
promptpal init ## init project with config
promptpal g ## generate types by config
```

We also offer node.js: [https://github.com/PromptPal/node-sdk](https://github.com/PromptPal/node-sdk) and golang: [https://github.com/PromptPal/go-sdk](https://github.com/PromptPal/go-sdk) SDKs.

## Conclusion

PromptPal could help you **finish work earlier**, giving you time for your hobbies, like swimming or spending time with loved ones.

**Run it right now!**

**Please note that PromptPal is still under **heavy development**.**
